I would colllaborate with a teammate by trying to work asynchronously, splitting the tasks between backend and frontend.

###If I had more time, I would

- have a server side validation for humility as well
- have test for endpoints
- have all CRUD operations for the superheroes
- have the React interface for the CRUD operations
- use a relational database instead of in-memory data
- use React components instead of having everything in App.js
- beautify the fronend
- implement a search functionality to further sort heroes
